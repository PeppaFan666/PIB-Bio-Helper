Designed to streamline Biology, this program will automate many tasks.

Current features:
-  Enter 2 Parent alleles and BioHelper will FOIL them and/or produce a dihybrid cross.
- Chi Squares
- Punnet Squares
- Sex-linked traits
- Co-dominance (only in sex-linked traits)
- Convert DNA strands into both RNA and more DNA

Planned Features:
- Co-dominance in all algorithms, not just sex linked traits
- Improve user experience - remove space-based architecture.
